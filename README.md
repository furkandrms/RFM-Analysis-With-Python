FLO, an online shoe store, wants to segment its customers and determine marketing strategies according to these segments. To this end, the behaviors of the customers will be defined and groups will be formed according to the clustering in these behaviors. It consists of the information obtained from the past shopping behaviors of customers who made their last shopping from Flo as OmniChannel (both online and offline shopping) in the years 2020-2021.
